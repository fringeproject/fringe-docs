# Beta & Development


## Beta phase

FringeProject is still in active development. What does it mean?

- If you use our frontend API directly, we may change some calls without notice.
- The runner may fail while scanning the Internet.

Because we are still developing our platform, we need feedback and testers.
If you want to help us, that good! Please send us a notification by email.


## Open source

Some parts of the project are open-source such as:

- `fringe-runner`: a `go` cross-platform executable we use to execute `jobs`.
- `fringe-docs`: a `mkdocs` static website to generate this documentation.
